RICHARD SERRA
AMERICAN, BORN 1939
For Richard Serra, space is a substance as tangible as sculpture. He uses materials and scale to alter perception and to engage the body, encouraging consciousness of our relation to space. The towering, curved steel forms of Wake were achieved with computer imaging and machines that manufacture ship hulls, including a demilitarized machine that once made French nuclear submarines. It is composed of five identical modules, each with two S-shaped sections positioned in inverted relation to one another—gently curving serpentines of convex and concave parts that suggest tidal waves or profiles of battleships. The surface of acid-washed, weather-proof steel reinforces this industrial effect. Wake's powerful silhouette belies a complex configuration of parts: the whole cannot be known at once, only experienced with physical movement and progressively over time.

CLAES OLDENBURG
AMERICAN, (BORN IN SWEDEN), 1929
AND COOSJE VAN BRUGGEN
AMERICAN, 1942 - 2009
Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen fabricate large-scale outdoor sculptures inspired by popular commercial objects. Inflated to a colossal scale and imbued with decidedly figurative characteristics, these familiar items, such as the typewriter eraser, are unlikely public monuments: images recognized by many, but ambiguous as civic messages. The typewriter eraser was a commonly available office tool when the artists initially conceived the sculpture, but by the time this example was made, the computer had eclipsed the popularity of the typewriter, making such quaint erasers nearly obsolete.

ALEXANDER CALDER
AMERICAN, 1898-1976
A third-generation American sculptor, Alexander Calder studied mechanical engineering before studying art. In the 1920s-1930s while in Paris, he developed two distinctive genres of sculpture: mobiles, or sculptures that move, and stabiles, which are stationary. Eagle, created at a time when Calder was recognized as one of the world's greatest sculptors, reveals the artist's distinctive combination of pragmatism and poetry. Architectural in its construction and scale, Eagle displays its curving wings, assertive stance, and pointy beak in a form that is weightless, colorful and abstract.

Alexander Calder was born in Lawton, Pennsylvania and moved to New York in 1923, attending the Art Students League, and traveled repeatedly to Paris, where he first exhibited his work in 1927. Calder retrospectives have been presented at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, the Guggenheim Museum, New York in 1964 and the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1976. Calder was awarded the Gold Medal for Sculpture by the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971, the year he created Eagle.

TONY SMITH
AMERICAN, 1912-1980
Initially trained as an architect, Tony Smith first experimented with sculpture when he was nearly fifty. Stinger, one of his most monumental works, recalls an ancient structure such as a fortress, with three closed sides and one open side inviting the viewer to cross a threshold to its interior. Composed of cross-sections of tetrahedral and octahedral shapes, the sculpture combines a simple plan and complex elevation; resting on a single point it appears to hover above the ground. Originally called One Gate, Smith titled Stinger after the popular cocktail that is deceptively sweet but slyly intoxicating.

ELLSWORTH KELLY
AMERICAN, 1923 - 2015
Ellsworth Kelly arrives at his work through a prolonged experience of observing nature and the distilling of observations and sensations to simple lines, planes and forms. Although its silhouette appears entirely abstract, Curve XXIV suggests a rust-hued autumn gingko leaf. The narrowest of relief sculptures, it projects and expansive space: its surface coloration and texture echo painting-a reflection of the artist's fascination with the overlap of these art forms.

ROY MCMAKIN
AMERICAN, BORN 1956
An artist, furniture maker and architect, Roy McMakin's work blurs the boundaries between these disciplines, and amplifies tensions between form, function, and meaning. Full of visual and verbal puns, Love & Loss, commissioned specifically for the Olympic Sculpture Park, includes benches that are functional and meaningful. Seating composed of words, the benches speak their own language. A tree forms the "V" of love, which will blossom seasonally, losing its leaves—a reminder of nature's cycling that mirrors human experience.

ROXY PAINE
AMERICAN, BORN 1966
Roxy Paine's graceful, towering, stainless steel tree evolved from a detailed analysis of a tree's structure, a composition reconstructed through drawings, computer diagrams, and architectural renderings. Comprising steel pipes of more than 20 different diameters, its heavy industrial plates support approximately 5,000 pounds of cantilevered branches. Camouflaged in the natural setting and light, Split reflects its surroundings and poses the question, "What is nature, what is art?"

LOUISE BOURGEOIS
AMERICAN (BORN FRENCH); BORN 1911, PARIS; DIED 2010, NEW YORK
Louise Bourgeois' functional Eye Benches I, II, III resemble giant observant eyes. The three sets of two benches, carved out of granite by Italian stonemasons, are distinguished from one another by variations in scale, form, and detailing, and by the size of the attached seats. The enlargement and displacement of the eye recall the perspectives of Surrealism, a source for these images. Visitors encounter the disembodied eyes, which seem to follow their every movement, and later discover that the enigmatic sculptural objects provide comfortable outdoor seating.
